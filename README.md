# Awesome LLM Security [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This is my ([Zhakshylyk Nurlanov](https://nurlanov.me/)) curated collection of papers on LLM security, a field that's rapidly gaining importance. This list is a *work in progress*, reflecting my personal exploration of the topic. Papers marked with "**" are ones I found particularly compelling, but the absence of such a mark doesn't imply lesser value â€” there's simply too much out there to cover! I invite your input to help expand and refine this resource. Understanding and enhancing LLM security is vital for ensuring the reliability and safety of these powerful models, and I hope this collection serves as a useful starting point for anyone interested in the field.
